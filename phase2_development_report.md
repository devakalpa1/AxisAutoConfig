# Phase 2 Development Report: Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool

## Overview

This report summarizes the implementation of Phase 2 of the "Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool." Building on the foundation established in Phase 1, this phase focused on implementing full camera configuration functionality, robust error handling, enhanced camera discovery, and CSV handling for both input and output.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. VAPIX and ONVIF Operations (camera_operations.py)

Full implementation of camera operations using VAPIX and ONVIF APIs:

- **create_initial_admin**: Implemented unauthenticated VAPIX call to create the first admin user on factory-new cameras. Added fallback logic to verify if credentials already work when a camera returns 401/403, accommodating cameras that aren't factory-new.

- **create_onvif_user**: Implemented two approaches:
  - Primary approach using VAPIX API with the special "onvif" security group
  - Fallback to ONVIF SOAP API using zeep if VAPIX method fails
  - Added username clash detection and password update capability

- **set_wdr_off**: Implemented VAPIX parameter update to disable Wide Dynamic Range

- **set_replay_protection_off**: Implemented VAPIX parameter update with special handling for cameras that don't support this parameter

- **set_final_static_ip**: Implemented two approaches for flexibility:
  - Modern JSON API for newer Axis cameras
  - Legacy param.cgi API for older models
  - Added subnet mask to prefix length conversion

- **get_camera_mac_serial**: Implemented dual methods to retrieve both MAC address and serial number:
  - Primary approach using parameter API
  - Fallback to basicdeviceinfo.cgi with XML parsing

All methods include robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and detailed logging.

### 2. Camera Configuration Workflow (unified_worker.py)

Implemented the complete camera configuration workflow in `ConfigurationWorker`:

- Structured, sequential configuration process:
  1. Create admin user
  2. Create ONVIF user
  3. Set WDR off
  4. Set Replay Protection off
  5. Determine final static IP based on mode (sequential or MAC-specific)
  6. Set static IP
  7. Wait for camera to come online at new IP
  8. Verify MAC/serial

- Graceful error handling that allows the workflow to continue to the next camera if a non-critical step fails

- Detailed status tracking of each operation for every camera

- Support for both sequential and MAC-specific IP assignment modes

- Progress tracking and real-time logging

### 3. Network Utilities (network_utils.py)

Created a new module with functions for:

- **wait_for_camera_online**: Waiting for a camera to come online after IP address change
- **ping_host**: Platform-independent ping function
- **validate_ip_address**: IP address format validation
- **is_ip_in_network**: Check if an IP is in a specific network range
- **check_port_open**: TCP port availability checking

### 4. Enhanced Camera Discovery (camera_discovery.py)

Improved camera discovery with Axis-specific detection capabilities:

- Multi-tiered detection approach:
  1. Basic connectivity check (ping)
  2. Axis-specific HTTP characteristics:
     - Server header analysis
     - Authentication realm analysis
     - Web interface redirect patterns
     - Response content analysis
  3. Fallback to basic HTTP connectivity

- More accurate detection of Axis cameras vs. other network devices

### 5. CSV Handling (csv_handler.py)

Enhanced CSV functionality:

- **Input Processing**:
  - Automatic detection of CSV format (sequential vs MAC-specific)
  - Robust validation of IP and MAC address formats
  - Support for different MAC address formats

- **Output Generation**:
  - Comprehensive inventory report format
  - Structured fields with standard information and operation results
  - Flattening of complex data structures for CSV compatibility

- **Testing Utilities**:
  - Added sample CSV generation function for testing

## Design Decisions and Implementation Details

### Robust Error Handling

A critical focus of Phase 2 was implementing comprehensive error handling:

1. **Retry Mechanism**: All remote operations include configurable retry counts and delays.
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Non-critical failures don't stop the entire process.
3. **Detailed Logging**: Verbose logging at appropriate levels for both debugging and user feedback.
4. **Structured Error Reporting**: Each operation maintains success/failure status and detailed error messages.

### Multi-Method Approach

For key operations, we implemented multiple methods with automatic fallbacks:

1. **IP Configuration**: Modern JSON API with fallback to legacy parameter API
2. **ONVIF User Creation**: VAPIX API with fallback to ONVIF SOAP
3. **Device Information Retrieval**: Parameter API with fallback to basicdeviceinfo.cgi

This approach maximizes compatibility across different Axis camera models and firmware versions.

### Camera Identification

The enhanced camera discovery improves accuracy by:

1. Not relying solely on ping, which may be disabled on some cameras
2. Looking for Axis-specific HTTP characteristics
3. Examining response headers and content for Axis signatures

### Thread Safety and QThread Usage

The `ConfigurationWorker` class properly implements QThread with:

1. Signal/slot connections for GUI updates without blocking
2. Progress tracking and real-time user feedback
3. Clean interruption handling through stop flags

## Known Limitations & Phase 3 Focus Areas

1. **DHCP Server Interface Binding**:
   - The DHCP server still binds to 0.0.0.0 rather than specific interfaces.
   
2. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Currently only supports digest authentication, while some cameras might use basic auth.
   
3. **VAPIX Implementation Gaps**:
   - Some camera models may use slightly different parameter paths or values.
   - More model-specific adaptations could be needed.
   
4. **Certificate Handling**:
   - SSL certificate verification is disabled (`verify=False`) to handle self-signed certificates.
   - A more secure approach would be to properly handle cert validation.

5. **IP Range Validation**:
   - Limited validation of IP ranges (e.g., checking if IPs are on the same subnet).

6. **Network Configuration Edge Cases**:
   - Handling dual-network cameras or specialized configurations needs improvement.

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. Address the current limitations noted above
2. Refine the GUI to provide better visual feedback during the configuration process
3. Add camera model detection and model-specific parameter adjustments
4. Include more detailed status information in the inventory report
5. Implement SSL certificate handling for secure communication
6. Expand the camera_operations module with more configuration options
7. Add batch import/export functionality for configuration templates
8. Improve progress visualization with detailed status indicators

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has transformed the Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool from a foundational shell to a fully functional application. The implementation now supports the complete camera configuration workflow including admin user creation, ONVIF user setup, WDR and replay protection configuration, and static IP assignment. The enhanced error handling and multi-method approach ensure robustness across different camera models and network conditions.
