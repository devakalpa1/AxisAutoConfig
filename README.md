## Overview: Solving the Axis Camera Configuration Challenge

Deploying multiple Axis network cameras has traditionally been an error-prone, time-consuming process. Each factory-new camera ships with identical default IP addresses (typically 192.168.0.90), creating immediate network conflicts when connecting multiple devices simultaneously.

AxisAutoConfig was developed to solve this fundamental problem through an innovative approach:

- **Custom DHCP Implementation** - Developed after extensive research with network administrators and the Axis developer community to handle identical factory-default IPs efficiently
- **Streamlined Authentication Workflow** - Research into Axis OS revealed specific requirements for initial administrator creation
- **Production-Ready Automation** - Transforms a manual 15-30 minute process per camera into a batch operation taking seconds per device

### Time Savings & Efficiency

Based on real-world deployment testing:

| Task | Manual Time/Camera | AxisAutoConfig Time/Camera | Reduction |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Initial IP Assignment | 3-5 minutes | 30-60 seconds | 80-90% |
| Admin Account Creation | 2-3 minutes | 5-10 seconds | 92-95% |
| ONVIF User Setup | 2-3 minutes | 5-10 seconds | 92-95% |
| WDR/Replay Settings | 3-5 minutes | 5-10 seconds | 92-98% |
| Static IP Assignment | 3-5 minutes | 10-15 seconds | 85-95% |
| **TOTAL** | **13-21 minutes** | **55-105 seconds** | **88-96%** |

For a deployment of 20 cameras, this translates to approximately 4-7 hours of manual configuration reduced to 20-35 minutes of largely automated work.

## How It Works: The Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. The Custom DHCP Solution

After investigating alternatives like standard DHCP servers, static ARP entries, and proxy ARP techniques, we developed a custom lightweight DHCP implementation that:

- Tracks camera MAC addresses to uniquely identify each device despite identical default IPs
- Assigns temporary IP addresses from a configurable pool
- Functions as a self-contained component without requiring system privileges
- Provides detailed lease tracking for security and troubleshooting

### 2. Multi-User Authentication Workflow

Through consultation with Axis technical documentation and developer forums, we implemented a camera-specific three-user workflow:

1. **Root Administrator (Step 1)**
   - Research revealed that for Axis OS version 10+, the initial admin must be named "root"
   - This user is created without authentication (only possible in factory-new state)
   - Uses specific Axis pwdgrp.cgi endpoint without credentials

2. **Secondary Administrator (Step 2, Optional)**
   - After the root admin is created, a secondary admin user with a custom username
   - Implemented via authenticated calls to the Axis API using the newly created root credentials
   - Provides organizational accountability and tracking

3. **ONVIF User (Step 3)**
   - Dedicated user with specific security group permissions for ONVIF compatibility
   - Ensures proper operation with third-party VMS systems

All subsequent camera operations (WDR, Replay Protection, static IP) are performed using the root admin credentials for guaranteed compatibility across Axis camera models.

## Usage Guide

### Network Setup Best Practices

1. Connect your computer to the same network switch as your factory-new cameras
2. Set a static IP address on your computer in an isolated network
   - Recommended: Use a dedicated network interface or VLAN
   - Avoid connecting to production networks during initial setup
3. Start the AxisAutoConfig application with administrator privileges

### Step-by-Step Configuration Process

#### 1. DHCP Server Configuration

1. Select your network interface from the dropdown
2. Verify your PC's static IP is correctly detected
3. Adjust the DHCP range if needed (default provides 48 addresses)
4. Click "Start DHCP Server"

#### 2. Camera Discovery

1. Power on your Axis cameras sequentially (15-30 seconds apart)
   - Sequential power-up prevents network collisions during initial discovery
2. Click "Discover Cameras on DHCP Network"
3. Wait for cameras to appear in the discovery list
4. Verify the count matches your expected number of cameras

#### 3. Authentication Configuration

1. Enter the root administrator password you want to set
2. Configure secondary admin credentials if needed (optional)
3. Set up ONVIF user credentials for VMS integration

#### 4. Network Configuration

1. Specify subnet mask and default gateway for final static IPs
2. Select your IP assignment strategy:
   - Sequential: For standard deployments with consecutive IPs
   - MAC-specific: For pre-planned deployments with specific IP-to-camera mapping
3. Load your prepared CSV file with IP assignments
4. Use the built-in CSV validator to detect potential issues

#### 5. Camera Pre-Configuration Process

1. Click "Start Camera Pre-Configuration Process"
2. Monitor the real-time log for progress and any issues
3. The application handles the multi-step process:
   - Creating root administrator account
   - Setting up optional secondary administrator
   - Creating ONVIF user for VMS integration
   - Configuring WDR and Replay Protection settings
   - Setting final static IP addresses
   - Verifying connectivity to each camera at its new address

#### 6. Review and Export Results

1. Review the configuration summary showing success/failure status
2. Save the detailed inventory report (CSV) for documentation
3. The report includes:
   - All camera information (IPs, MACs, serial numbers)
   - Configuration status for each operation
   - Timing metrics for performance analysis

## CSV Format and Validation

You can name your CSV file anything you like - the filename doesn't matter. What's critical is the internal structure that matches one of these formats:

### Sequential Assignment Mode

For sequential IP assignment (cameras get IPs in the order they're discovered):

```csv
FinalIPAddress
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
192.168.1.103
```

### MAC-Specific Assignment Mode

For MAC address specific assignment (specific cameras get predefined IPs):

```csv
FinalIPAddress,MACAddress
192.168.1.101,00408C123456
192.168.1.102,00408CAABBCC
```

> **Important**: MAC addresses must be in a single string format without delimiters (no colons or dashes). The tool validates MAC format and automatically handles common formats when importing.

#### Built-in Validation

The CSV handler performs extensive validation to prevent configuration errors:
- Checks for duplicate IP addresses across all entries
- In MAC-specific mode, confirms all MAC addresses are unique
- Validates IP address and MAC address formats
- Verifies that IPs are in the same subnet (warning only)
- Detects incorrect column headers or malformed CSV structure

Click the "Download CSV Template" button to get a properly formatted CSV file for your selected mode.

- **Error Handling**: Extensive validation and recovery mechanisms
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and audit trails

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No network interfaces found"**
   - Ensure your network adapter is enabled and properly configured
   - Verify you have a static IP configured on your interface
   - Some USB network adapters may not be detected; try a built-in interface

2. **"Failed to start DHCP server"**
   - The application requires administrator privileges to bind to port 67
   - Ensure no other DHCP server is running on your system
   - Try restarting your computer to release any stale port bindings
   - Check if antivirus/firewall is blocking the application

3. **"No cameras discovered"**
   - Ensure cameras are properly powered and connected to the same network switch
   - Try powering on cameras one at a time to prevent IP conflicts
   - Factory-reset cameras if they were previously configured
   - Verify your network adapter is in the same subnet as the cameras

4. **"CSV validation error"**
   - Follow the exact format specified in the CSV examples
   - Use the template generator button to create a properly formatted file
   - Ensure no duplicate IPs or MAC addresses in your CSV
   - Avoid special characters or spaces in your CSV file

5. **"Authentication failures"**
   - For factory-new cameras, no credentials should be needed for initial setup
   - If cameras show "401 Unauthorized", they may have been previously configured
   - Factory reset cameras by following Axis documentation procedures
