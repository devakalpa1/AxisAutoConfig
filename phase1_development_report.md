# Phase 1 Development Report: Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool

## Overview

This report summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 of the "Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool." Phase 1 focused on establishing the core architecture, GUI shell, DHCP management, basic discovery, input collection, and function stubs for VAPIX/ONVIF interactions.

## What Was Implemented

### Project Structure & Modules

The project was structured according to the specified requirements, with the following Python modules:

1. **unified_gui_app.py**: Main application window using PySide6, with the primary GUI layout divided into the four required sections:
   - Host PC Network Setup & DHCP Server Configuration
   - Camera Discovery & Configuration Inputs
   - Pre-Configuration Process & Real-time Log
   - Completion & Next Steps / Save Report (placeholder for Phase 1)

2. **dhcp_manager.py**: Custom DHCP server implementation that can be configured, started, and stopped through the GUI. Provides functionality to:
   - Detect network interfaces using psutil
   - Configure IP range, lease time, and server IP
   - Start and stop the DHCP server
   - Track and manage DHCP leases
   - Handle DHCP DISCOVER and REQUEST packets
   - Issue DHCP OFFER and ACK packets

3. **camera_discovery.py**: Implements basic camera discovery based on DHCP leases, with functionality to:
   - Check device connectivity using ping
   - Test HTTP connections to verify web interfaces
   - Structure for future enhanced discovery capabilities

4. **camera_operations.py**: Contains function stubs for VAPIX and ONVIF interactions as specified:
   - create_initial_admin
   - create_onvif_user
   - set_wdr_off
   - set_replay_protection_off
   - set_final_static_ip
   - get_camera_mac_serial

5. **unified_worker.py**: Implements QThread subclasses for running background tasks:
   - DHCPWorker for the DHCP server
   - DiscoveryWorker for camera discovery
   - ConfigurationWorker (stub for Phase 1)

6. **csv_handler.py**: Handles CSV input/output with functionality to:
   - Read IP assignment CSV files (supporting both sequential and MAC-specific formats)
   - Validate IP and MAC address formats
   - Structure for future report generation

7. **main.py**: Application entry point that sets up logging and launches the GUI.

8. **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies (PySide6, psutil, requests, zeep).

### GUI Implementation

The GUI was implemented using PySide6 with a responsive layout that adapts to system light/dark themes. Key features include:

- QSplitter-based layout allowing users to resize sections
- Network interface detection and display
- DHCP server configuration inputs with default settings
- Camera discovery table showing DHCP IPs and MAC addresses
- Configuration input fields for admin credentials, ONVIF users, and network settings
- CSV file loading for IP assignment
- Real-time logging interface
- Menu structure with File and Help options

## Custom DHCP Server Management

### Design Approach

The custom DHCP server was implemented using Python's socket library for low-level packet handling. Key design decisions included:

1. **Direct Socket Implementation**: Rather than using external libraries, a custom implementation was created to have full control over the DHCP server's behavior and ensure it can be easily integrated into the application.

2. **Threading Model**: The DHCP server runs in a background thread (QThread) to keep the GUI responsive. Communication between the DHCP server thread and the GUI is handled via Qt's signals and slots.

3. **Configuration Options**: The DHCP server can be configured with:
   - IP address range
   - Lease time
   - Server IP (acting as gateway/DNS)
   - Specific network interface binding

4. **Packet Processing**: The implementation handles the core DHCP protocol:
   - DISCOVER → OFFER
   - REQUEST → ACK
   - Lease tracking and management
   - Option handling (subnet mask, gateway, lease time)

5. **Thread Safety**: Synchronized access to shared resources (like the lease database) using threading locks.

### Lease Management

- Leases are tracked in a dictionary mapping MAC addresses to (IP, lease_end_time) tuples
- When a device reconnects, it receives the same IP if the lease is still valid
- The server maintains a pool of available IPs and manages assignment

## Camera Discovery Approach

Camera discovery is based on the DHCP leases provided by the custom DHCP server. For each leased IP address:

1. A basic connectivity check is performed (ping)
2. HTTP connection testing is performed to check if port 80 is open
3. Any responsive device is considered a potential Axis camera

The discovery process runs in a background thread and updates the UI in real-time as cameras are found.

In Phase 1, discovery is basic and doesn't perform Axis-specific verification, which would be added in future phases.

## Known Limitations & Phase 2 Focus Areas

1. **DHCP Server**:
   - The current implementation binds to 0.0.0.0 rather than a specific interface. In Phase 2, true interface-specific binding should be implemented.
   - Error handling could be improved, particularly for socket binding issues.
   - DHCP NAK handling is not implemented for Phase 1.

2. **Camera Discovery**:
   - No Axis camera-specific detection (e.g., checking model, firmware) - this will be added in Phase 2.
   - Discovery relies only on DHCP leases, and doesn't perform broader network scanning.

3. **Camera Configuration**:
   - All VAPIX and ONVIF functions are stubs in Phase 1 and need full implementation in Phase 2.
   - Error handling and recovery strategies for camera configuration need to be developed.

4. **GUI**:
   - The Completion & Next Steps section is a placeholder in Phase 1.
   - Progress indicators during camera configuration should be added.

5. **Security**:
   - Password fields store plain text in memory - should consider more secure approaches.
   - No validation of secure password policies.

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. Complete the VAPIX and ONVIF API implementations to enable actual camera configuration.
2. Enhance camera discovery with Axis-specific detection methods.
3. Implement the end-to-end camera configuration workflow.
4. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies.
5. Implement the inventory report generation functionality.
6. Add configuration validation to ensure all settings are appropriate before applying.
7. Address DHCP server limitations noted above.
8. Add progress tracking and status updates during the configuration process.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has established a solid foundation for the Axis Camera Unified Setup & Configuration Tool. The core architecture, GUI shell, and DHCP server components have been implemented according to requirements. The next phase will build on this foundation to create a fully functional application capable of completing the end-to-end camera configuration workflow.
